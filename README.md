# Nexus-LU-Launcher-Uchu-Docs
This repository contains documents for using
[Nexus LU Launcher](https://github.com/UchuServer/Uchu) with
[Uchu](https://github.com/TheNexusAvenger/Nexus-LU-Launcher).

# Documents
If you are trying to play a server hosted by someone
else, you only need the client setup. If you want to
play Uchu single-player, complete the server setup and
the client setup.

* [Server Setup (Uchu)](Server-Setup-Uchu.md)
* [Client Setup](Client-Setup.md)

# Uchu Is Incomplete
Uchu is not complete and contains both missing features
and game-breaking bugs. While you can get a few hours
of gameplay uninterrupted, the game can't be played
completely.
